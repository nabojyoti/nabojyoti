# üëã About Me

I'm **Nabajyoti Pandey**, a passionate data enthusiast with a keen interest in Generative AI, Machine Learning, and Data Engineering. My journey began with a curiosity about how data can drive decisions and has since evolved into building scalable data pipelines and intelligent applications.

I've spent the past few years engineering scalable data pipelines, deploying real-time risk models, and building interactive analytics dashboards ‚Äî powering everything from derivative clearing and HFT backtesting to machine learning‚Äìbased portfolio optimization.

I'm particularly fascinated by the intersection of data and technology, aiming to harness this synergy to create impactful solutions.
