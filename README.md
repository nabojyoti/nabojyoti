# 👋 About Me

I'm **Nabojyoti Pandey**, a data and AI engineer focused on building **agentic AI systems, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, and scalable machine learning platforms**.
  
A **Microsoft Azure Certified AI Engineer** and **Kaggle Notebook Expert**, I work at the intersection of GenAI, data engineering, and production ML.

Over the past few years, I’ve engineered scalable data pipelines, deployed real-time risk and analytics systems, and built intelligent applications supporting use cases ranging from derivative clearing and HFT backtesting to ML-driven portfolio optimization.

I’m particularly interested in designing **reliable, interpretable, and production-ready AI systems**, leveraging multi-agent architectures, orchestration frameworks, and cloud-native infrastructure to translate complex data into actionable intelligence.
